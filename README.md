She has had thoughts like: “But there are so many experts out there, I’ll never know as much as them.”, “How can I start writing Kotlin when I don’t know all the features there are in the language?” . The biggest lesson she has learnt about learning Kotlin, is to just try write it. In this talk, she will cover some of the nifty features she has learnt about Kotlin, as well as the many different ways she has gone about trying to learn this new language, slowly overcoming her imposter syndrome whilst writing Kotlin code. 


## Android Architecture Components: A testable approach to Android Development

Accepted: DevConf 2018  (27 March 2018)

Developing Android Apps has notoriously been a difficult task. Previously, Google refrained from giving advice as to how you should go about architecting your Android applications and it has been “left it up to the reader” to decide how. This lead to apps having a lot of bloat in their activities and being really difficult to test. This has now changed since Google I/O 2017 where the new Android Architecture components were introduced. The libraries aim to make developing and maintaining your Android apps a lot easier. In this presentation, Rebecca will present the components and dive into detail around the different types of tests you should write (and where) for your newly architected Android application.
